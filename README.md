## Hi there, I'm Nathan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Development graduate and passionate Java developer with a strong focus on clean architecture, testing, and real-world problem solving.

Recently, I built a fully-featured **console-based banking system** from scratch â€” complete with user authentication, account management, transaction handling, and database persistence.

- âœ… Java (OOP, Interfaces, Inheritance)
- âœ… JDBC with H2 Database
- âœ… Unit & Integration Testing (JUnit + Mockito)
- âœ… Clean architecture with separation of concerns
- âœ… Basic security
