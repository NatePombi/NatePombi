## Hi there, I'm Nathan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Development graduate and passionate Java developer with a strong focus on clean architecture, testing, and real-world problem solving.

Iâ€™ve built multiple projects from scratch, including a fully-featured banking system and an Inventory Management System API, showcasing my backend development skills with Java, Spring Boot, and databases.

* âœ… Java (OOP, Interfaces, Inheritance, Generics)
* âœ… JDBC with MySQL + H2 for testing
* âœ… Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data JPA
* âœ… Unit & Integration Testing (JUnit + Mockito)
* âœ… REST API design & JWT Authentication
* âœ… CI/CD with GitHub Actions + JaCoCo + Codecov
* âœ… PostgreSQL & H2 Database
* âœ… Clean architecture with full separation of concerns
* âœ… Environment-based configuration & secure password handling
