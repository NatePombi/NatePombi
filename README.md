## Hi there, I'm Nathan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Development graduate and passionate Java developer with a strong focus on clean architecture, testing, and real-world problem solving.

Recently, I built a fully-featured console-based banking system from scratch â€” complete with user authentication, account management, transaction handling, database persistence, and CI integration.

- âœ… Java (OOP, Interfaces, Inheritance)
- âœ… JDBC with MySQL + H2 for testing
- âœ… Unit & Integration Testing (JUnit + Mockito)
- âœ… CI/CD with GitHub Actions + JaCoCo + Codecov
- âœ… Clean architecture with full separation of concerns
- âœ… Secure password handling
- âœ… Environment-based configuration
